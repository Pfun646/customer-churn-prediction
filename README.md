# customer-churn-prediction
Predicting customer churn using machine learning. Covers data collection, preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, normalization), and model development. Includes EDA, feature engineering, and model evaluation to identify churn factors and improve retention. Ideal for data scientists and businesses aiming to reduce churn.
ustomer Churn Prediction

Introduction
Customer churn is a critical concern for Internet Service Providers (ISPs) as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to analyze customer data, identify factors influencing churn, and build predictive models to anticipate customer attrition. By leveraging machine learning, ISPs can take proactive measures to enhance customer retention and improve service offerings.

Data Collection
Gather data from customer records, transaction logs, service usage reports, and support interactions.
Ensure the dataset includes key attributes such as customer demographics, service plans, contract details, payment history, and churn status.
Verify data integrity and consistency by cross-referencing multiple sources.
Data Exploration
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and distribution of data.
Generate summary statistics to identify trends in churn behavior.
Use data visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps) to uncover hidden patterns.
Identify potential outliers and inconsistencies in the dataset.
Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values:
df["Churn Category"].fillna("Non Churned", inplace=True)
df["Churn Reason"].fillna("Non Churned", inplace=True)
Encode categorical variables using label encoding or one-hot encoding.
Normalize numerical features using techniques like Min-Max scaling or Standardization.
Remove duplicate records and irrelevant features.
Engineer new features, such as customer tenure, usage frequency, and complaint resolution time, to enhance model performance.
Model Development
Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 or 70/30 split).
Select appropriate machine learning algorithms, including:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)
Neural Networks
Train models using supervised learning techniques.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
ROC-AUC curve
Model Optimization
Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Use feature selection methods to improve model efficiency.
Implement techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) if the dataset is imbalanced.
Deployment & Monitoring
Deploy the trained model as an API or integrate it into a customer relationship management (CRM) system.
Develop a real-time dashboard to display churn predictions and insights.
Continuously monitor model performance and retrain it periodically with new data.
Implement automated alerts for early detection of potential churn risks.
Business Insights & Recommendations
Identify key factors contributing to customer churn, such as poor customer service, high pricing, or network issues.
Develop targeted retention strategies, such as loyalty programs, discounts, or personalized support.
Optimize marketing campaigns by identifying at-risk customers and offering tailored incentives.
Improve service quality based on customer feedback and predictive insights.
